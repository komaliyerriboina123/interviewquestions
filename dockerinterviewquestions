1) What is the difference between Virtualization and Containerization?

Answer:
Virtualization uses a hypervisor to run multiple OS instances on hardware, while containerization runs applications in isolated containers sharing the same OS kernel, making containers lighter and faster.

2) Why do we need to go for Containerization?

Answer:
To ensure application portability, faster deployments, consistency across environments, and efficient resource utilization.

3) Which version of Docker are you using in your project?

Answer:
We are using Docker 24.x (Docker CE).
(You can adjust the version if needed.)

4) Can you explain what a Dockerfile is?

Answer:
A Dockerfile is a text file containing instructions to build a Docker image, such as base image, dependencies, environment variables, and startup commands.

5) Write a Dockerfile to deploy a Spring Boot application

FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY target/app.jar app.jar
EXPOSE 8080
ENTRYPOINT ["java","-jar","app.jar"]

6) What is the difference between CMD and ENTRYPOINT?

Answer:

CMD provides default arguments and can be overridden

ENTRYPOINT defines the main executable and cannot be easily overridden

7) How do you build a Docker image?

docker build -t springboot-app .

8) What will be there inside a Docker image?

Answer:
Base OS layer, application binaries, dependencies, libraries, environment variables, and metadata.

9) How will you set Docker image privileges?

Answer:
By running containers with limited privileges using:

docker run --user 1001 --cap-drop ALL
and avoiding --privileged unless required.

10) How do you compress a Docker image?
docker save image_name | gzip > image.tar.gz

11) Why do we need Docker Compose?

Answer:
Docker Compose is used to manage multi-container applications using a single YAML file.

12) Write a sample Docker Compose file

Answer:
A Dockerfile is a text file containing instructions to build a Docker image, such as base image, dependencies, environment variables, and startup commands.

11) Why do we need Docker Compose?

Answer:
Docker Compose is used to manage multi-container applications using a single YAML file.

12) Write a sample Docker Compose file
version: '3'
services:
  app:
    image: springboot-app
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"

13) How do you attach a Docker volume to a container?

Answer:

docker run -v /host/data:/container/data image_name
14) How do you see logs of a container?

Answer:

docker logs container_id

15) Why do we need Docker Network?

Answer:
Docker networks allow secure communication between containers and provide isolation.

16) Docker commands you have used?

Answer:
docker build, docker run, docker ps, docker images, docker logs, docker exec, docker stop, docker rm, docker rmi

17) Where are you maintaining your project Docker images?

Answer:
We store Docker images in Docker Hub / AWS ECR / Nexus Repository.

18) How do you upload a Docker image?

Answer:

docker tag image repo/image
docker push repo/image

19) How are Docker containers created in your project?

Answer:
Containers are created using Docker Compose or automated CI/CD pipelines.

20) What is Docker Swarm?

Answer:
Docker Swarm is Docker’s native container orchestration tool used to manage and scale containers across multiple nodes.
