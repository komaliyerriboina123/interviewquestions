1) What is Kubernetes and why do we need it?

Answer:
Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform used to deploy, scale, and manage containerized applications. We need it to handle auto-scaling, self-healing, load balancing, and zero-downtime deployments in production environments.

2) Explain Kubernetes architecture and its components

Answer:
Kubernetes follows a master–worker architecture.

Master components: API Server, Scheduler, Controller Manager, etcd

Worker components: Kubelet, Kube-proxy, Container Runtime
The master manages the cluster, and worker nodes run application pods.

3) Which Kubernetes cluster are you using in your project?

Answer:
We are using a managed Kubernetes service (AWS EKS) for better scalability, security, and reduced operational overhead.

4) What is Pod life cycle in Kubernetes?

Answer:
Pod lifecycle includes phases like Pending → Running → Succeeded/Failed → Terminated. Kubernetes automatically recreates pods if they fail.

5) What is a Static Pod?

Answer:
A static pod is managed directly by the kubelet, not by the API server. These pods are mainly used for control plane components.

6) Why do we need Namespaces in Kubernetes?

Answer:
Namespaces are used to logically isolate resources, manage access control, and organize environments like dev, QA, and prod within the same cluster.

7) What services are available in Kubernetes and differences?

Answer:

ClusterIP: Internal communication

NodePort: Exposes service on node IP

LoadBalancer: Exposes service using cloud LB

Headless Service: Direct pod access
We use LoadBalancer or Ingress for external access.

8) How are you deploying your project in Kubernetes?

Answer:
We deploy applications using Deployment manifests, container images from a registry, and expose them using Service and Ingress.

9) Who is responsible for writing Kubernetes manifest YAML?

Answer:
DevOps engineers write and maintain Kubernetes manifests in collaboration with developers.

10) Write a sample Kubernetes Deployment YAML
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: app-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app
        image: myapp:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080

11) What is the purpose of Labels and Selectors?

Answer:
Labels are key-value pairs used to identify resources, and selectors are used by services and deployments to select matching pods.

12) Which deployment strategy are you following?

Answer:
We use Rolling Update strategy to ensure zero downtime during application deployments.

13) What is Ingress in Kubernetes?

Answer:
Ingress manages external HTTP/HTTPS access to services and provides features like SSL termination and path-based routing.

14) Where have you configured your project domain?

Answer:
The domain is configured in Route53 (DNS) and mapped to the Ingress LoadBalancer.

15) Can you open and show your project in Google?

Answer:
Yes, once the domain is mapped to the Ingress and DNS is configured, the application is accessible publicly via browser.

16) How do you check container logs?

Answer:

kubectl logs pod-name


For a specific container:

kubectl logs pod-name -c container-name

17) Database pod started but tables are not created – how to troubleshoot?

Answer:
Check container logs, verify environment variables, initialization scripts, mounted volumes, and ensure the DB init script is configured correctly.

18) How do you check DB tables created or not?

Answer:
By exec into the pod:

kubectl exec -it pod-name -- bash


Then log into the database and check tables.

19) How is application deployed in cluster in your project?

Answer:
Code → Git → Jenkins builds Docker image → push to registry → Kubernetes Deployment updates → Rolling update happens automatically.

20) What is Headless Service?

Answer:
A Headless Service does not assign a ClusterIP and allows direct pod-to-pod communication, mainly used with StatefulSets.

21) Difference between Kubernetes and OpenShift?

Answer:

Kubernetes is an open-source orchestration platform

OpenShift is an enterprise Kubernetes platform with built-in security, CI/CD, and developer tools

⭐ Strong Interview Closing Line:

Kubernetes helps us run containerized applications in a highly available, scalable, and production-ready manner.
