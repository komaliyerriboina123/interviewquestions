Answer:
CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment, where code changes are automatically built, tested, and deployed to ensure faster and reliable software releases.

2) What is Master–Slave configuration in Jenkins?

Answer:
Master–Slave (Controller–Agent) configuration allows Jenkins master to manage jobs while agents execute builds, improving scalability and performance.

3) What is Pipeline in Jenkins?

Answer:
A Jenkins pipeline is a set of automated steps defined as code (Jenkinsfile) that describes the build, test, and deployment process.

4) Which pipeline are you using (scripted or declarative)?

Answer:
Declarative pipeline, because it is structured, easier to maintain, and supports built-in validations.

5) What is the difference between scripted and declarative pipeline?

Answer:

Scripted: Written in Groovy, flexible, complex

Declarative: Structured syntax, easier to read and maintain

6) What are the stages available in pipeline?

Answer:
Common stages include Checkout, Build, Test, Code Quality, Artifact Upload, Deploy.

7) How many pipelines are available in your project?

Answer:
We maintain multiple pipelines based on application and environment such as CI pipeline, CD pipeline, and release pipeline.

8) How do you deploy code from a particular branch?

Answer:
By configuring branch-based pipelines using Git branch filters or parameters in Jenkinsfile.

9) What is your pipeline trigger condition?

Answer:
Pipelines are triggered using Git webhooks, scheduled builds, or manual triggers based on requirements.

10) If one stage fails in pipeline then what will happen?

Answer:
By default, the pipeline stops execution and marks the build as failed.

11) If any stage fails and you don’t want to stop, how do you execute remaining stages?

Answer:
By using catchError, try-catch, or post conditions to handle failures and continue execution.

12) How to take Jenkins backup?

Answer:
By backing up JENKINS_HOME directory which contains jobs, plugins, configurations, and credentials.

13) In production Jenkins internet is not available, then how to install plugins?

Answer:
Download plugins manually (.hpi/.jpi) and install them via Advanced Plugin Manager or copy to plugins directory and restart Jenkins.

14) What plugins have you used in Jenkins server?

Answer:
Git, Pipeline, GitHub Integration, Maven, Docker, Kubernetes, Nexus, SonarQube, Email Extension, Credentials Binding.

15) How do you manage user permissions in Jenkins (developer should not edit pipeline)?

Answer:
By enabling Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and assigning read-only or limited permissions to developers while restricting pipeline edits.
