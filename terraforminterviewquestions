1) What is Terraform and why do we need to use it?

Answer:
Terraform is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool used to provision and manage cloud resources using code. We use Terraform to automate infrastructure creation, maintain consistency across environments, enable version control, reduce manual errors, and easily recreate or scale infrastructure.

2) Could you please show one Terraform script (by sharing your screen)?

Answer (explain verbally in interview):
Yes. I’ll show a simple Terraform script that creates an EC2 instance in AWS.

provider "aws" {
  region = "ap-south-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-0abcdef12345"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  key_name      = "my-key"

  tags = {
    Name = "terraform-ec2"
  }
}


Explanation:

Provider defines AWS

Resource block creates EC2

Terraform manages lifecycle (create, update, destroy)

3) Which resources have you created in AWS using Terraform?

Answer:
Using Terraform, I have created:

EC2 instances

VPC, Subnets, Route Tables

Security Groups

Load Balancers (ALB)

Auto Scaling Groups

IAM roles and policies

S3 buckets

EKS cluster and node groups

All resources are managed through Terraform state and reused across environments like dev, QA, and prod.
