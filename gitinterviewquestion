1) What is branching strategy in GitHub?

Answer:
A branching strategy defines how branches are created, used, and merged. Common strategies include Git Flow, Feature Branching, and Trunk-Based Development to manage development, testing, and releases safely.

2) What is a Pull Request in GitHub?

Answer:
A Pull Request (PR) is a request to merge changes from one branch into another, usually from a feature branch to main. It allows code review, discussion, and approval before merging.

3) What is the difference between Merge and Rebase commands?

Answer:

Merge combines branches and creates a merge commit, preserving history

Rebase moves commits to a new base, creating a clean and linear history

4) What is Git Bisect command?

Answer:
git bisect is used to find the commit that introduced a bug by performing a binary search between good and bad commits.

5) What is Git Squash command?

Git squash combines multiple commits into a single commit, usually during rebase, to keep commit history clean.

6) What is Git Stash command?

Answer:
git stash temporarily saves uncommitted changes so you can switch branches without committing them.

7) Have you ever faced merge conflicts and how did you resolve them?

Answer:
Yes. I resolved merge conflicts by identifying conflicting files, manually correcting the code, validating changes, and then committing the resolved version after testing.

8) Who will create Git repositories in your project and who will tell you to create a new repository?

Answer:
Usually, DevOps leads or repository admins create repositories. New repositories are created based on requirements from project managers, architects, or DevOps leads.

9) How are you managing GitHub permissions for team members?

Answer:
Permissions are managed using GitHub roles like Admin, Maintainer, Write, and Read, along with branch protection rules and team-based access.

10) What is Branch Lock?

Answer:
Branch lock (branch protection) prevents direct pushes, enforces pull requests, reviews, and CI checks, ensuring code stability on critical branches like main.
