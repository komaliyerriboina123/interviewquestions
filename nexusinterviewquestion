Answer:
An artifact repository is a centralized storage system used to store, version, and manage build artifacts such as JARs, WARs, Docker images, and Helm charts.

2) Why are you using Nexus Repository in the project?

Answer:
We use Nexus to store and manage build artifacts, improve build performance through caching, maintain version control, and ensure secure and reliable artifact delivery across environments.

3) What is snapshot repository and release repository?

Answer:

Snapshot repository stores artifacts under active development and allows frequent updates

Release repository stores stable, immutable artifacts used for production deployments

4) Do you have a Remote Repository for the project?

Answer:
Yes, we configure remote repositories to proxy external repositories like Maven Central or Docker Hub, reducing external dependency downloads and improving build reliability.

5) How do you secure your remote repository?

Answer:
Remote repositories are secured using role-based access control (RBAC), authentication, SSL/TLS, firewall restrictions, and by restricting anonymous access and enforcing credentials for uploads.
